The robots.txt and humans.txt are both text files that can be found in the root of a website.

### robots.txt

### humans.txt
the humans.txt is a way for people that have taken part in the creation of the website to show it. The file which only
sits in the root of the website have no impact on the website and can be accessed by adding humans.txt to the url, for
example if you would like to see this sites humans.txt you would have to go to
