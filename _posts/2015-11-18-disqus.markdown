Implementing disqus was one of the easier things, I was actually so surprised when it just worked after some copy and pasting from
Disqus homepage that i thought that I must have done something wrong ;)

After creating an account at Disqus I could just the following code with my information already in it from their site.

{% highlight ruby %}
<div id="disqus_thread"></div>
<script>
    /**
     *  RECOMMENDED CONFIGURATION VARIABLES: EDIT AND UNCOMMENT THE SECTION BELOW TO INSERT DYNAMIC VALUES FROM YOUR PLATFORM OR CMS.
     *  LEARN WHY DEFINING THESE VARIABLES IS IMPORTANT: https://disqus.com/admin/universalcode/#configuration-variables
     */
    /*
     var disqus_config = function () {
     this.page.url = PAGE_URL;  // Replace PAGE_URL with your page's canonical URL variable
     this.page.identifier = PAGE_IDENTIFIER; // Replace PAGE_IDENTIFIER with your page's unique identifier variable
     };
     */
    (function() {  // DON'T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE
        var d = document, s = d.createElement('script');

        s.src = '//fredriko.disqus.com/embed.js';

        s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date());
        (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s);
    })();
</script>
<noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript" rel="nofollow">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript>

{% endhighlight %}

Then I just put this into a seperate HTML file called comments, then it gets imported to the blog posts using liquid and the static site generator.
Of course it took some time to figure it out but when I read the instructions it became a lot easier ;)
