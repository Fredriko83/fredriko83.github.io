### Steep hill to climb...
I have now spent around two weeks playing around with Jekyll and it's been a long and troublesome road. Since I already think the
combination of HTML, CSS and Javascript is quite confusing at the beginning Jekyll didn't help at all. But as usual, the more i played around the more i learned.
I don't know how many hours I have spent just trying to find something I know that I seen before somewhere, So there have been
times where Jekyll have been very frustrating but for the most part it's been a really fun
and educational experience.

### The good:
Now that i actually got used to Jekyll I really like the way a small change in code can lead to a big difference on the site.
Compared to "regular" HTML and CSS it's really easy to change something on the site and see the effect on all the affected pages.
This also means that i don't have to finish a template or be sure about my design before i can start working on content because
if i have to change something later on I will only do in one place!

### The bad:
The only bad thing I can see is the time it takes learning it, and if you just want to make a really simple site and aren't expecting to
make any big changes to it it might not be worth the time to do with Jekyll. If I would have just made this site the "old way" i probably had took a lot
less time than it took now, but now I have learned a lot about Jekyll so the next time i do something similar or when i want to redo this site
it will take a lot less time than it took now or the time it would take the "regular way".

### Conslusion:
Because of the added level of complexity that Jekyll added I did at times in the beginning pass on design and features I would have done
with regular HTML/CSS but in the end it had changed to the opposite, I tried things I wouldn't have time/the energy to try in
regular HTML/CSS.
