My name is Fredrik Olsson and I am a student at Linneaus University in Sweden. The program I am enrolled in is called Software
Development and Operations (Utveckling och drift av mjukvarusystem in Swedish). At the time I publish this site (2015-11-15) I'm still on my first semester. Besides school
which takes an enormous amount of time I spend my time with my Cairn terrier Ines, and once in a while i try go to the gym.
Before my studies i worked with consumer electronics, everything from sales to support, service and logistics. It's 
actually my experiences from my old workplaces that led me to apply for this education. And the reason is that all the 
it-systems i ever worked in have been flawed and i guess i got tired of not being able to do anything about it. So now I am
taking my chance to learn development! Among the hobbies that I no longer seem to find time for are: Hanging out with friends, 
taking my motorcycle for a spin, movies, tv-series and video games. But I'm not complaining, it has never been this much fun
going to school and even though programming sometimes drive me totally crazy I can't see myself doing anything else anymore :)
